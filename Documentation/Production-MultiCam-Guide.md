# Production Multi-Camera Implementation Guide

## Overview

This AVCam app now includes a **production-quality multi-camera implementation** based on Apple's AVFoundation documentation. The implementation uses `AVCaptureMultiCamSession` to enable simultaneous capture from both front and rear cameras.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. AVCaptureMultiCamSession Setup
**Location**: `AVCam/CaptureService.swift` (lines 150-259)

The implementation follows Apple's best practices:

- **Session Creation**: Uses `AVCaptureMultiCamSession` when supported
- **Format Selection**: Filters for `isMultiCamSupported` formats
- **No Automatic Connections**: Uses `addInputWithNoConnections` for precise control
- **Explicit Connections**: Creates `AVCaptureConnection` objects for each camera-output pair
- **Dual Outputs**: Separate `MovieCapture` instances for primary and secondary cameras
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to single-camera mode if multi-cam fails

#### 2. Multi-Camera Format Configuration
**Location**: `AVCam/CaptureService.swift` (lines 261-297)

```swift
private func configureMultiCamFormat(for device: AVCaptureDevice) throws {
    // Filter for multi-cam compatible formats
    let supportedFormats = device.formats.filter { $0.isMultiCamSupported }
    
    // Select best format
    guard let format = supportedFormats.sorted(by: preferredFormatComparator).first else {
        try configureSingleCameraFormat(for: device)
        return
    }
    
    // Apply format
    device.activeFormat = format
    
    // Configure frame rate
    if let frameRateRange = format.videoSupportedFrameRateRanges.sorted(by: { $0.maxFrameRate > $1.maxFrameRate }).first {
        device.activeVideoMinFrameDuration = frameRateRange.minFrameDuration
        device.activeVideoMaxFrameDuration = frameRateRange.maxFrameDuration
    }
}
```

#### 3. Simultaneous Recording
**Location**: `AVCam/CaptureService.swift` (lines 953-968)

Both cameras record simultaneously:

```swift
func startRecording() {
    movieCapture.startRecording()
    secondaryMovieCapture?.startRecording()  // Both cameras start
}

func stopRecording() async throws -> Movie {
    if let secondaryMovieCapture {
        async let primaryMovie = movieCapture.stopRecording()
        async let companionMovie = secondaryMovieCapture.stopRecording()
        let primary = try await primaryMovie
        let companion = try await companionMovie
        return Movie(url: primary.url, companionURL: companion.url)  // Returns both videos
    }
    return try await movieCapture.stopRecording()
}
```

#### 4. Multi-Camera Preview
**Location**: `AVCam/Views/MultiCamPreview.swift`

Supports four layout modes:
- **Picture-in-Picture**: Main camera full screen, secondary in corner
- **Side-by-Side**: Split screen vertically
- **Grid**: Split screen horizontally
- **Custom**: Configurable layout

Each preview uses `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` with explicit connections:

```swift
let layer = AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer(sessionWithNoConnection: session)
let connection = AVCaptureConnection(inputPort: port, videoPreviewLayer: layer)
session.addConnection(connection)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Video Stabilization
Both primary and secondary connections use automatic video stabilization:

```swift
movieConnection.preferredVideoStabilizationMode = movieConnection.isVideoStabilizationSupported ? .auto : .off
secondaryConnection.preferredVideoStabilizationMode = secondaryConnection.isVideoStabilizationSupported ? .auto : .off
```

#### Audio Routing
Audio is captured from the default microphone and routed to the primary video output:

```swift
if let audioPort = audioInput.ports.first(where: { $0.mediaType == .audio }) {
    let audioConnection = AVCaptureConnection(inputPorts: [audioPort], output: movieCapture.output)
    session.addConnection(audioConnection)
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring
The app includes performance metrics tracking:

```swift
struct PerformanceMetrics {
    let frameRate: Double
    let cpuUsage: Double
    let memoryUsage: UInt64
    let thermalState: ProcessInfo.ThermalState
    let batteryLevel: Float?
}
```

## Technical Specifications

### Session Configuration

- **Session Type**: `AVCaptureMultiCamSession`
- **Primary Camera**: Best available back camera (wide, ultra-wide, or telephoto)
- **Secondary Camera**: Front camera (TrueDepth or standard)
- **Audio Input**: Default microphone
- **Primary Output**: `AVCaptureMovieFileOutput` for back camera
- **Secondary Output**: `AVCaptureMovieFileOutput` for front camera
- **Photo Output**: `AVCapturePhotoOutput` (primary camera only)

### Format Selection

The app selects formats based on:
1. Multi-camera support (`isMultiCamSupported`)
2. Resolution (prefers higher resolution)
3. Frame rate (prefers higher frame rates)
4. Video stabilization support

### Connection Management

All connections are created explicitly:
- Photo output → Primary camera
- Primary movie output → Primary camera + Audio
- Secondary movie output → Secondary camera
- Primary preview → Primary camera
- Secondary preview → Secondary camera

### Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Format configuration failures → Fallback to single camera
- Connection failures → Throws `CameraError.multiCamConfigurationFailed`
- Device unavailability → Throws `CameraError.videoDeviceUnavailable`
- Session interruptions → Automatic recovery when possible

## Troubleshooting

### Multi-Camera Button Not Appearing

**Check**:
- Are you in Video mode? (Multi-cam only works in video mode)
- Is the app running on a physical device?
- Does your device support multi-camera? (iPhone 11 Pro or newer)

### Only One Camera Preview Visible

**Check**:
- Is multi-camera actually active? (Check for blue badge)
- Check console logs for configuration errors
- Verify device compatibility

### Recording Only Saves One Video

**Check**:
- Was multi-camera active when recording started?
- Check console logs for secondary capture errors
- Verify storage space available

### Layout Not Changing

**Check**:
- Are you currently recording? (Layout locked during recording)
- Is multi-camera active?
- Try stopping and restarting the app

### Performance Issues

**Monitor**:
- Thermal state (multi-camera is resource-intensive)
- Battery level (drains faster with dual cameras)
- Available storage (two videos require more space)

**Solutions**:
- Reduce recording duration
- Lower resolution if needed
- Ensure device is not overheating

## Best Practices

### For Optimal Performance

1. **Thermal Management**: Multi-camera recording generates significant heat
   - Avoid extended recording sessions
   - Monitor thermal state
   - Allow device to cool between sessions

2. **Battery Management**: Dual-camera capture drains battery faster
   - Keep device charged during extended use
   - Monitor battery level
   - Consider external power for long sessions

3. **Storage Management**: Two videos require double the storage
   - Monitor available storage
   - Regularly transfer videos to computer
   - Consider cloud backup

4. **Format Selection**: The app automatically selects optimal formats
   - Formats are chosen for multi-cam compatibility
   - May not be the highest resolution available
   - Prioritizes stability over maximum quality

### For Best Results

1. **Lighting**: Ensure good lighting for both cameras
2. **Stability**: Use a tripod or stable surface
3. **Audio**: Position device for optimal audio capture
4. **Testing**: Test multi-camera before important recordings
